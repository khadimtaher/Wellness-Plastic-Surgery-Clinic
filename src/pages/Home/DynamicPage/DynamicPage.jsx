The primary goal of this surgery is to restore both function and appearance by reconnecting the bones, blood vessels, nerves, tendons, and skin. The procedure begins with careful preservation of the amputated part, usually by wrapping it in sterile gauze and keeping it cool to maintain tissue viability. Once the patient reaches the hospital, surgeons evaluate whether the amputated part is suitable for re-implantation, considering factors such as the time since injury, level of contamination, and overall condition of the patient.",

Alternative reconstructive options may be recommended if re-implantation is not viable.",

      description: `An arteriovenous (A.V.) fistula is a surgically created connection between an artery and a vein, usually in the arm, to provide reliable access for patients undergoing long-term hemodialysis. It is considered the gold standard for vascular access due to its durability, lower risk of infection, and better blood flow compared to catheters or grafts.

During the procedure, a surgeon connects a vein directly to an artery, allowing the vein to enlarge and strengthen over time. This makes repeated needle insertions for dialysis safe and effective. Most fistulas are created in the forearm or upper arm, depending on the patientâ€™s vascular condition.

The surgery is performed under local or regional anesthesia with minimal discomfort. After surgery, the fistula requires a few weeks to mature before it can be used for dialysis. Patients receive guidance on fistula care to ensure proper healing and long-term functionality.

Our approach emphasizes safety, precision, and patient educationâ€”helping individuals with kidney disease maintain effective dialysis treatment and improved quality of life.`,

      title: "Varicose Veins Surgery",
      description: `Varicose veins are enlarged, twisted veins that often appear in the legs due to weak or damaged vein valves. They can cause discomfort, swelling, heaviness, and sometimes serious complications if left untreated. 

Varicose veins surgery involves removing or closing affected veins to restore healthy blood flow and improve both function and appearance. With advancements in vascular care, most treatments today are minimally invasive, ensuring faster recovery and excellent cosmetic results. 

Common surgical options include endovenous laser therapy (EVLT), radiofrequency ablation (RFA), sclerotherapy, and vein stripping in severe cases. These procedures are performed under local or regional anesthesia with minimal downtime. 

Our vascular specialists focus on personalized treatment, addressing both cosmetic concerns and medical complications such as pain, skin changes, or ulcers. Post-surgery, patients experience relief from symptoms, improved circulation, and renewed confidence.`,

Corns can cause significant discomfort, pain while walking, and in some cases lead to infections if left untreated.  

The procedure involves carefully trimming or excising the corn under sterile conditions, often under local anesthesia. In certain cases, minor surgical removal of the root may be performed to prevent recurrence.  

Corn removal is a quick, safe, and highly effective treatment that provides instant relief from pain and discomfort, allowing patients to walk comfortably again. Proper footwear, regular foot care, and addressing the root cause of pressure are essential to prevent corns from reappearing.`,

      description: `Pilonidal sinus is a common condition that usually occurs near the cleft of the buttocks, where small holes or tunnels form under the skin. These tunnels can collect hair, pus, or fluid, leading to pain, swelling, and recurrent infections. If left untreated, it often causes discomfort in sitting, walking, or performing daily activities.

At our clinic, pilonidal sinus is treated using minimally invasive and advanced surgical techniques designed to provide lasting relief. Our procedures focus on removing the sinus tract completely while minimizing scarring and promoting faster healing. Patients benefit from reduced pain, minimal blood loss, and quicker return to normal life compared to traditional methods.  

We also emphasize preventing recurrence through proper wound management, hygiene guidance, and follow-up care. Every treatment plan is personalized based on the severity of the condition, ensuring the best possible outcome. With our expertise and compassionate approach, patients experience long-term relief, improved comfort, and restored confidence in their daily activities.

      title: "Rhinoplasty (Nose Reshaping Surgery)",
      description: `Rhinoplasty, commonly known as a nose job, is a surgical procedure designed to enhance the appearance and functionality of the nose. Whether performed for cosmetic reasons or to correct breathing issues, rhinoplasty helps achieve better facial harmony while improving nasal structure.

Our approach combines aesthetic precision with medical expertise, ensuring that the results look natural and complement the patientâ€™s facial features. Rhinoplasty can address a variety of concerns, including nasal hump reduction, reshaping the nasal tip, correcting asymmetry, or repairing structural issues caused by injury or congenital conditions.

The surgery is performed under anesthesia to ensure patient comfort, and modern techniques are used to minimize scarring and downtime. Recovery time is typically short, with most patients resuming normal activities within a week, while final results gradually become visible as swelling subsides.

Our focus is on personalized treatment plans that meet both cosmetic and functional goals, ensuring long-term satisfaction and improved confidence.`,
